# MY CP HUSTLE

Starting today, 8th October 2023, I am going to practice competitive programming to my best.

## Motivation

Has any Indian team ever achieved first rank in ACM-ICPC?
The best ever rank for an Indian team at the ICPC World Finals is 18, secured by teams from IIT Delhi & IIIT Hyderabad back in 2012. **No Indian team has won the gold yet**.

My motivation is to win gold medal for India in ACM-ICPC 2025.

That's it, let's get into it!
